**Requirements**

**Introduction**
This project is about increasing the safety and security of an electric vehicle.Nowadays all are busy in their scheduled lifecycle and while driving a vehicle the person who rides the bike forget that he removed the side stand and by this so many accidents occur and the scond parameter is security for an electric vehicle there will be a key and if worst cases without the key the vehicle starts ignition and to overcome this problem we increase the security level as to start ignition with the fingerprint of the rider so the vehiclesecurity increases and it is theft free.


**Research**
In the research I came across the challenges facing in the society about the security of a vehicle and the safety measures that we have to undergone while riding a vehicle.


**Cost and Features and Timeline**
In the cost point of view the cost is a bit lesser as the we are implementing the code for the fingerprint access to the elecric vehicle and the overall cost comes under the micro controller and the fingerprint sensor to be affixed to an existing vehicle.
Coming to features the project is featured as to overcome the issues arising due to the security issues of an electric vehicle.
Finally the Timeline for this project is very less and we can implement this in a very short span of time and it doesn't consume more work load.
